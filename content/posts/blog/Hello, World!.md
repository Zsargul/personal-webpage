Hello! I'm Zsargul and this is my first post on my new personal website!

If you're reading this, I hope you find the stuff on here interesting (that is, whatever little substance
there is to find here considering this is the first post after all). I plan to use my this here tiny corner
of the web to post anything and everything I find interesting or feel like discussing. That may include essays
on various topics, book reviews, rants, fiction/stories I've written, and so on. Pretty standard stuff, but
hopefully you find it interesting regardless. The site is made with the help of the Hugo framework, which I
learned thanks to Luke Smith and his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I) video.

As this is the first post, the site is unsurprisingly barebones as I'm still learning how to script in Hugo
efficiently and I'm busy styling stuff in CSS. I doubt that's a problem however since the chances of someone
finding the site at this time are almost non-existent (quite literally, since I haven't even hosted the site
anywhere as of writing this post). However, given time I hope I'll have some interesting things written and
posted here. I also hope that you find anything you read on here just as interesting and enjoyable as I did
when writing it!
